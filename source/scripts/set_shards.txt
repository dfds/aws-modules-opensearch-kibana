## The following should be set upon creation of the cluster 
## to ensure that new indexes get created with 1 shard by default 
## as there is a limit of 1000 shards per node and by default 
## 5 shards per node get created which soon reaches this limit.
## Only indexes with special requirements should have shards increased 
## which can be done per index pattern with a new template
##
## It can be sent as a PUT request to the endpoint after provisioning
